Name of Game: Simon Says
Description: This game is known as Simon Says, where the computer will select one of the squares and highlight them to make it visible to user, it also contains beep sounds for every square that it selects. The game begins with the cpu selecting one square, and the user will then have to mimic that same action in order for the game to continue. The increase of each round is represented in the changes of levels, and theres is also a timer, which can be used to test your capabilities. After each round, the game will also increase the sequence its going at by 1 and will continue to do so as long as the user continues to follow the sequence. If the user fails to match the sequence, the user would be met with a message of "GameOver", meaning that the game is over and the user now has to click on Begin Game to restart the game.
